  title: Backpack Exchange API
  description: "\n# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Backpack Exchange API. This API is for programmatic trade execution. All of the endpoints require requests to be signed with an ED25519 keypair for authentication.\n\nThe API is hosted at `https://api.backpack.exchange/` and the WS API is hosted at `wss://ws.backpack.exchange/`.\n\n# Authentication\n\n\n## Signing requests\n\nSigned requests are required for any API calls that mutate state. Additionally, some read only requests can be performed by signing or via session authentication.\n\nSigned requests require the following additional headers:\n\n- `X-Timestamp` - Unix time in milliseconds that the request was sent.\n- `X-Window` - Time window in milliseconds that the request is valid for, default is `5000` and maximum is `60000`.\n- `X-API-Key` - Base64 encoded verifying key of the ED25519 keypair.\n- `X-Signature` - Base64 encoded signature generated according to the instructions below.\n\nTo generate a signature perform the following:\n\n1) The key/values of the request body or query parameters should be ordered alphabetically and then turned into query string format.\n\n2) Append the header values for the timestamp and receive window to the above generated string in the format `&timestamp=<timestamp>&window=<window>`. If no `X-Window` header is passed the default value of `5000` still needs to be added to the signing string.\n\nEach request also has an instruction type, valid instructions are:\n\n```\naccountQuery\nbalanceQuery\nborrowLendExecute\nborrowHistoryQueryAll\ncollateralQuery\ndepositAddressQuery\ndepositQueryAll\nfillHistoryQueryAll\nfundingHistoryQueryAll\ninterestHistoryQueryAll\norderCancel\norderCancelAll\norderExecute\norderHistoryQueryAll\norderQuery\norderQueryAll\npnlHistoryQueryAll\npositionQuery\nquoteSubmit\nwithdraw\nwithdrawalQueryAll\n```\n\nThe correct instruction type should be prefixed to the signing string. The instruction types for each request are documented alongside the request.\n\nFor example, an API request to cancel an order with the following body:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"orderId\": 28\n    \"symbol\": \"BTC_USDT\",\n}\n```\n\nWould require the following to be signed:\n\n```text\ninstruction=orderCancel&orderId=28&symbol=BTC_USDT&timestamp=1614550000000&window=5000\n```\n\nIf the API endpoint requires query parameters instead of a request body, the same procedure should be used on the query parameters. If the API endpoint does not have a request body or query parameters, only the timestamp and receive window need to be signed.\n\nThis message should be signed using the private key of the ED25519 keypair that corresponds to the public key in the `X-API-Key` header. The signature should then be base64 encoded and submitted in the `X-Signature` header.\n\n\n<br /><br />\n\n---\n\n# Changelog\n\n## 2024-12-03\n\n- Add order expiry reason to order update stream.\n- Add `cumulativeInterest` to borrow lend position.\n\n## 2024-12-02\n\n- Add borrow lend history per position endpoint.\n\n## 2024-11-10\n\n- Add `timestamp` field denoting the system time in unix-epoch microseconds to the depth endpoint.\n\n## 2024-10-15\n\n- Convert all error responses to JSON and add a error code.\n\n## 2024-05-14\n\n- Add `executedQuantity` and `executedQuoteQuantity` to order history endpoint.\n\n## 2024-05-03\n\n- Add single market order update stream `account.orderUpdate.<symbol>`.\n\n## 2024-05-02\n\n- Add optional `from` and `to` timestamp to get withdrawals endpoint.\n\n## 2024-05-01\n\n- Add optional `from` and `to` timestamp to get deposits endpoint.\n\n## 2024-03-14\n\n- Add optional `orderId` filter to order history endpoint.\n- Add optional `from` and `to` timestamp to order fills endpoint.\n\n## 2024-02-28\n\n- Return the withdrawal in request withdrawal response.\n\n## 2024-02-24\n\n- An additional field `t` was added to the private order update stream. It is the `trade_id` of the fill that generated the order update.\n- Added a maximum value for the `X-Window` header of `60000`.\n\n## 2024-01-16\n\n### Breaking\n\n- A new websocket API is available at `wss://ws.backpack.exchange`. Please see the documentation. The previous API remains on the same endpoint and will be deprecated after a migration period. The new API changes the following:\n  - Subscription endpoint is now `wss://ws.backpack.exchange` instead of `wss://ws.backpack.exchange/stream`.\n  - Can subscribe and unsubscribe to/from multiple streams by passing more than one in the `params` field.\n  - Signature should now be sent in a separate `signature` field.\n  - Signature instruction changed from `accountQuery` to `subscribe`.\n  - Event and engine timestamps are now in `microseconds` instead of `milliseconds`.\n  - Add engine timestamp to `bookTicker`, `depth`, and `order` streams.\n  - Add quote asset volume to ticker stream.\n  - Add sequential trade id to trade stream.\n  - Rename the event type in the depth stream from `depthEvent` to `depth`.\n  - Change the format of streams from `<symbol>@<type>` to `<type>.<symbol>` or `kline.<interval>.<symbol>` for K-lines.\n  - Flatten the K-Line in the K-line stream so its not nested.\n\n## 2024-01-11\n\n### Breaking\n\n- Replaced `identifier` field on deposits with `transaction_hash` and `provider_id`.\n  This aims to provide clearer representation of the field, particularly for fiat deposits.\n- Removed duplicate `pending` values from the `WithdrawalStatus` and `DepositStatus` spec enum.\n\n\n<br /><br />\n\n---\n    "

    # Usage

    ## Subscribing

    To use the websocket API, connect to
    `wss://ws.backpack.exchange`.

    To subscribe to a stream with the name `stream` send a text frame
    over the websocket connection with the following JSON payload:

    ```
    {
      "method": "SUBSCRIBE",
      "params": ["stream"]
    }
    ```

    Similarly, to unsubscribe from a stream with the name `stream`:

    ```
    {
      "method": "UNSUBSCRIBE",
      "params": ["stream"]
    }
    ```

    You can subscribe or unsubscribe from multiple streams if you include
    more than one in the params field.

    All data from streams is wrapped in a JSON object of the following form:

    ```
    {
      "stream": "<stream>",
      "data": "<payload>"
    }
    ```

    The following command can be used to test subscribing to a stream:
    ```
    (sleep 1; \
    echo '{"method":"SUBSCRIBE","params":["depth.SOL_USDC"]}';\
    cat) |\
    wscat -c wss://ws.backpack.exchange
    ```
    The payloads for each stream time are outlined below.

    ## Timing

    Timestamps are in microseconds (except for the K-line start and end
    times). The event timestamp is the time the event was emitted from
    the websocket server, and the engine timestamp is the time the event
    was generated by the matching engine.

    If a message aggregates more than one event (for example, a depth
    message), the engine timestamp will be the timestamp of the last
    matching engine event.

    ## Keeping the connection alive

    To keep the connection alive, a `Ping` frame will be sent from the
    server every 60s, and a `Pong` is expected to be received from the
    client. If a `Pong` is not received within 120s, a `Close` frame will be
    sent and the connection will be closed.

    If the server is shutting down, a `Close` frame will be sent and then a
    grace period of 30s will be given before the connection is closed. The
    client should reconnect after receiving the `Close` frame. The client
    will be reconnected to a server that is not shutting down.

    # Private

    Subscribing to a private stream requires a valid signature generated
    from an ED25519 keypair. For stream subscriptions, the signature
    should be of the form:

    ```text
    instruction=subscribe&timestamp=1614550000000&window=5000
    ```

    Where the timestamp and window are in milliseconds.

    Private streams are prefixed with `account.` and require signature data
    to be submitted in the subscribe parameters. The verifying key and
    signature should be base64 encoded.

    ```
    {
      "method": "SUBSCRIBE",
      "params": ["stream"],
      "signature": ["<verifying key>", "<signature>", "<timestamp>", "<window>"]
    }
    ````

    ## Order update

    On any mutation to an order the order will be pushed to the order update
    stream. The event type of the order update will be one of the
    following:

    - `orderAccepted`
    - `orderCancelled`
    - `orderExpired`
    - `orderFill`

    ### Stream Name Format
    - For all markets: `account.orderUpdate`
    - For single market: `account.orderUpdate.<symbol>`

    ```
    {
      "e": "orderAccepted",   // Event type
      "E": 1694687692980000,  // Event time in microseconds
      "s": "SOL_USD",         // Symbol
      "c": 123,               // Client order ID
      "S": "Bid",             // Side
      "o": "LIMIT",           // Order type
      "f": "GTC",             // Time in force
      "q": "32123",           // Quantity
      "Q": "32123",           // Quantity in quote
      "p": "20",              // Price
      "P": "21",              // Trigger price
      "X": "Filled",          // Order state
      "R": "PRICE_BAND",      // Order expiry reason
      "i": "1111343026172067" // Order ID
      "t": 567,               // Trade ID
      "l": "1.23",            // Fill quantity
      "z": "321",             // Executed quantity
      "Z": "123",             // Executed quantity in quote
      "L": "20",              // Fill price
      "m": true,              // Whether the order was maker
      "n": "23",              // Fee
      "N": "USD",             // Fee symbol
      "V": "RejectTaker",     // Self trade prevention
      "T": 1694687692989999   // Engine timestamp in microseconds
    }
    ```

    Some fields are conditional on the order settings or event type:

    - `c` - Only present if the order has a client order ID.
    - `q` - Only present if the order has a quantity set.
    - `Q` - Only present if the order is reverse market order.
    - `p` - Only present if the order is a limit order.
    - `P` - Only present if the order is a trigger order.
    - `R` - Only present if the event is a `orderExpired` event.
    - `t` - Only present if the event is a `orderFill` event.
    - `l` - Only present if the event is a `orderFill` event.
    - `L` - Only present if the event is a `orderFill` event.
    - `m` - Only present if the event is a `orderFill` event.
    - `n` - Only present if the event is a `orderFill` event.
    - `N` - Only present if the event is a `orderFill` event.

    ## Position update

    On any mutation to a position the position will be pushed to the
    position update stream. The event type of the position update will
    be one of the following:

    - `positionAdjusted`
    - `positionOpened`
    - `positionClosed`

    On subscription, a message will be sent to the client with the current
    open positions, if any. The `e` field will not be present in the
    message.

    ### Stream Name Format
    - For all markets: `account.positionUpdate`
    - For single market: `account.positionUpdate.<symbol>`

    ```
    {
      "e": "positionOpened",  // Event type
      "E": 1694687692980000,  // Event time in microseconds
      "s": "SOL_USD_PERP",    // Symbol
      "b": 123,               // Break event price
      "B": 122,               // Entry price
      "l": 50,                // Estimated liquidation price
      "f": 0.5,               // Initial margin fraction
      "M": 122,               // Mark price
      "m": 0.01,              // Maintenance margin fraction
      "q": 5,                 // Net quantity
      "Q": 6,                 // Net exposure quantity
      "n": 732 ,              // Net exposure notional
      "i": "1111343026172067" // Position ID
      "p": -1,                // PnL realized
      "P": 0,                 // PnL unrealized
      "T": 1694687692989999   // Engine timestamp in microseconds
    }
    ```

    The net quantity field will be positive if the position is long and
    negative if the position is short.

    The net exposure quantity field includes exposure from the open
    position, as well as any open orders.

    ## RFQ Update

    This WebSocket stream provides real-time updates on RFQs (Request for
    Quotes) that are relevant to makers. Events are pushed to this
    stream whenever there is a significant state change in an RFQ or its
    associated quotes, allowing makers to monitor and respond to RFQs as
    they progress through various states.

    ### Event Types

    - `rfqActive`: Indicates that an RFQ is active and open for quotes.
    - `quoteAccepted`: Indicates that a quote submitted by the maker has
    been accepted.
    - `quoteCancelled`: Indicates that a quote has been cancelled due to
    quote submission, RFQ being filled, refreshed, cancelled, or expired.
    - `rfqFilled`: Indicates that an RFQ has been fully filled with a quote
    from the maker.

    ### Quote Submission and RFQ Timing

    Makers should submit quotes before the **submission time** (`w` field)
    is reached, as indicated in each `rfqActive` event. An RFQ remains
    active until the **expiration time** (`W` field). If no quote is
    accepted or the RFQ is not cancelled, makers may continue to submit
    quotes until expiration.

    RFQs can periodically request new quotes by issuing additional
    `rfqActive` events. Each new `rfqActive` event will have the same
    RFQ ID (`R` field) but updated values for **submission time** and
    **expiration time**, allowing makers to participate in extended or
    renewed quoting periods for ongoing RFQs.

    ### Stream Name Format
    - For all markets: `account.rfqUpdate`
    - For single market: `account.rfqUpdate.<symbol>`

    ### Example Messages

    # Public

    ## Book ticker

    Stream name format: `bookTicker.<symbol>`
    ```
    {
      "e": "bookTicker",          // Event type
      "E": 1694687965941000,      // Event time in microseconds

      "A": "1.000",               // Inside ask quantity
      "b": "18.67",               // Inside bid price
      "B": "2.000",               // Inside bid quantity
      "u": "111063070525358080",  // Update ID of event
      "T": 1694687965940999       // Engine timestamp in microseconds
    }
    ```

    ## Depth

    Contains incremental depth updates. Each depth update has the absolute
    value of the depths at the given levels, and only changes when the
    depth has changed.

    To obtain an initial snapshot of the depth, the client should query the
    [REST API](https://docs.backpack.exchange/#tag/Markets/operation/get_depth).

    The depth stream will push updates as quickly as possible, but under
    load it may aggregate more than one update into a single event. In
    this case the `U` and `u` fields will not be the same. The `U` field
    is the first update ID in the event, and the `u` field is the final
    update ID in the event.

    There is an alternative depth stream that aggregates updates into a
    single message over a 200ms period instead of pushing updates in
    realtime. This is useful for reducing network traffic.

    Updates are sequential, so `U` will always be `u + 1` from the previous
    message. If this is not the case, the client should assume that the
    depth has been invalidated and requery the REST API.

    Stream name format: `depth.<symbol>` (realtime)
    Stream name format: `depth.200ms.<symbol>` (aggregated)
